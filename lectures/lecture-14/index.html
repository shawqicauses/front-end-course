0. CSS Cascade, Specificity, and Inheritance.
- these three concepts are the foundation of CSS.
- they control how CSS properties are applied to an element and how conflicts between different CSS declarations are resolved.

1. Conflicting Rules
- the way the CSS cascade behaves is a key to understanding CSS.
- cascade and specificity are closely related concepts, and they are the mechanisms that control which rule applies when there is such a conflict.
- inheritance means that some CSS properties by default inherit values set on the current element's parent and some do not.
- these three concepts work together.

2. CSS Cascade
- at a very simple level, it means that the origin, the cascade layer, and the order of CSS rules matter.
- when two rules from the same cascade layer apply and both have equal specificity, the one that is defined last in the CSS file wins (will be used).

3. CSS Specificity
- is the algorithm that the browser uses to decide which property value is applied to an element.
- if multiple CSS declarations have different selectors that configure the same property with different values, specificity decides the property value that gets applied.
- an element selector is less specific, it has less weight. Pseudo-elements selectors have the same specificity as element selectors.
- a class selector is more specific, it has more weight. Attribute selectors and pseudo-classes have the same specificity as class selectors.
- an ID selector is the most specific, it has the highest weight.

4. CSS Inheritance
- some CSS property values set on the parent elements are inherited by their child elements, and some are not.

5. Controlling Inheritance
- CSS provides special universal property values for controlling inheritance. Every CSS property accepts these values.
- inherit: set the property value to be the same as that of its (direct) parent element. Basically, it turns on inheritance.
- initial: set the property value to be the initial value of that property.
- unset: set the property value to be the natural value of the property. It means if the property is naturally inherited it will act like `inherit`, other-wise it will act like `initial`.

6. Resetting CSS `all: unset;`

7. More About CSS Cascade/Specificity
- there are three factors to consider (the listed items below are sorted from the less important to the most important):

A. Source Order
B. Specificity
C. Importance

7. A. Source Order
- the one that comes last in the source order wins.
- source order only matters when the rules has the same specificity.

7. B.1. Specificity
- the listed selectors below are sorted from the less specific to the most specific:

1. Universal Selector (*)
2. Type/Element Selector (h1 - p - section)
3. Class Selector (.box-1)
4. Attribute Selector ([href])
5. ID Selector (#box-1)
6. Inline Style (style="color: red;")
7. !important

7. B.2. Specificity Calculations
- the amount of specificity a selector has is measured using three different things/components, ID (identifier), class (class selector, attribute selector, or pseudo-class), and element (element selector or pseudo-element).
- [INLINE STYLE]-[ID]-[CLASS]-[ELEMENT]
