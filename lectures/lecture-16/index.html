More About JavaScript Variables/Data Types/Type Conversion

0. Re-fresh our knowledge about JavaScript variables
let myName = "Shawqi Hatem"; -> Variable Initialization
let myAge; -> Variable Declaration
myAge = 30; -> Variable Assignment

let someoneName = "I do not know", someoneAge, someoneJob; -> Declaring Multiple Variables At Once

In memory storage it will look like something like this:
someoneName = "Shawqi Hatem"
someoneAge = undefined
someoneJob = undefined

1. Declaring Variables Using Const
- to declare a constant (unchanging) variable, we use `const` instead of `let`.
- variables declared using `const` are called `constants`.
- constants can not be re-declared/re-assigned a new value.
- there is wide-spread practice to use constants for aliases for difficult-to-remember values. Such constants are named using capital letters and underscores.

const COLOR_RED = "#F00";

2. Const vs. Let vs. Var
- const: const declarations must be initialized with a value.
- const: can not be re-declared/re-assigned a new value.
- let: can be re-assigned a new value - but can not be re-declared.
- var: can be re-declared/re-assigned a new value.

- const and let are block-scoped, while var is function-scoped.
- in strict mode, a ReferenceError will occurred if you try to declare a value without using `const`, `let`, or `var`.

3. Name Things Right (fun assignment search for it)

4. Data Types
- a value in JavaScript is always of a certain type.
- we can put any type in a variable. Also, we can re-assign a variable with a different type. Programming languages that allow such things are called dynamically typed languages, meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not typed.
- there are eight basic data types in JavaScript:
1. Number
2. BigInt (fun assignment search for it)
3. String
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Object
8. Symbol (fun assignment search for it)

1. Number
- represents a numeric value (both integers and floating-point numbers).
- there are many operations for numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
- besides regular numbers, there are so-called "special numeric values" that are used in JavaScript, such as `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN`.
- `NaN` stands for "Not a Number", which is a special value that represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation.
- mathematical operations are safe in JavaScript.

2. String
- a string value must be surrounded by quotes: "" - '' - ``
- no difference between double-quotes and single-quotes.
- Backticks are "extended functionality" quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${}.
- the expression inside is evaluated and the result becomes a part of the string.
- statements and expressions?!
- we will cover more about strings in the upcoming lectures.

3. Boolean
- a boolean value can be either `true` or `false`.
- the type is commonly used to store yes/no values.
- boolean values can also come as a result of comparisons (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=).
- we will cover more about booleans in the upcoming lectures.

4. The `null` value
- the special `null` does not belong to any of the types described above.
- in JavaScript `null` is not a reference to a non-existing object or a null pointer like in some other languages. It is just a special value which represents "nothing", "empty", or "value unknown".

5. The `undefined` value
- the special `undefined` also stands alone. It makes a type of its own, just like `null`.
- the meaning of undefined is that the variable has not been assigned a value.

6. Objects
- the `object` type is special.
- the other types are called primitive types because their values can contain only one single thing. In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.

7. The `typeof` operator
- the `typeof` operator returns the type of a value.

8. Interactions: Alert, Prompt, and Confirm
- alert, prompt, and confirm are functions to interact with the user in the browser env.
- alert: shows a message and waits for the user to press "OK".
- prompt: shows a message and waits for the user to enter a value.
- confirm: shows a message and waits for the user to press "OK" or "Cancel".
