## Introduction

Web developers build websites for clients who want to showcase themselves, their services, or products on the web.

**_Web developers are categorized into three main categories_**:

1. Front-End Developers.
2. Back-End Developers.
3. Full-Stack Developers.

### Front-End Developers

They are responsible for everything the user sees on the website, starting with implementing a website design (i.g. a Figma design) into the actual website, including the presentation of the content and the user interface elements, such as the navigation bar, text, images, buttons, etc.

In modern web development, front-end developers are also responsible for dynamically rendering the website's content by fetching data from APIs and generating the website's content based on the fetched data. (Social Media Example).

Finally, front-end developers mainly use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and their relevant frameworks to build effective websites with excellent user experiences.

### Back-End Developers

They are responsible for building the web servers and ensuring the data is stored in a database, processed (i.g., authentication, authorization), and delivered to the front-end developers through APIs or other alternatives. Hence, they have what they need to generate the right website content.

This process was more complicated in the past, and developers do not use only one methodology for building websites today in web development. However, we will keep it like this until we explain it in one of the theoretical sessions.

### Full-Stack Developers

They are comfortable doing both :)

### How to start building websites and HTML Basics

Computers are stupid! They do not understand human language. You must tell them this is a `.png` file to realize that this image must open in an image viewer software. You must tell them this is a `.docx` file to recognize that this is a Word or any other content-editable document that must open in a text editor software. We inform computers by making files with specific extensions that align with our needs.

**_You do not need to be brilliant to guess that it is the same with websites!_**

We must tell them that this file is a website that must be opened in a browser. To do this, we must create a file with the `.html` extension.

#### Why the `.html` extension?

Because browsers only understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All these three languages work together to make us a fancy website.

HTML is the markup language or the raw data that a website page is built from. It creates all the text, images, links, lists, buttons, and forms.

CSS is the styling language that adds style to these HTML elements. It controls fonts, colors, backgrounds, widths, heights, and layouts.

JavaScript is the programming language that adds interactivity to our website.

In short, HTML puts information on a website page, CSS positions that information by adding styles, and JavaScript adds interactivity for the user with the information.

**_HTML is the (noun), CSS is the (adjective), and JavaScript is the (verb) :)_**

So, let us start by building our first HTML page!
